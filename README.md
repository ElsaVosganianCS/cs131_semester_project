Hello! This is my semester project for CS 131 Discrete Structures. In the presentation, I go over crochet and how to use crochet to model mathematical concepts. This is an important connection because crochet is worked very much like an algorithm, going through sequences of stitches to create fabric. My presentation covers some of the mathematical structures that can be made with crochet, and a tutorial at the end for making one of my favorite projects to date.
